# Udacity-FWD (DLND) Deep Learning Nanodegree Program
 Deep Learning Nanodegree Program Projects
 
###Overview
The Deep Learning Nanodegree program offers you a solid introduction to the world of artificial intelligence.
In this program, you’ll master fundamentals that will enable you to go further in the field, launch or advance
a career, and join the next generation of deep learning talent that will help define a beneficial, new,
AI-powered future for our world. You will study cutting-edge topics such as Neural Networks, Convolutional
Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Network Deployment,
and build projects in PyTorch and NumPy. You’ll learn from authorities such Ian Goodfellow and Jun-Yan
Zhu, inventors of types of generative adversarial networks, as well as AI experts, Sebastian Thrun and Andrew
Trask. For anyone interested in this transformational technology, this program is an ideal point-of-entry.
The program is comprised of 5 courses and 5 projects. Each project you build will be an opportunity to
prove your skills and demonstrate what you’ve learned in your lessons. 

### What You Will Learn

### Deep Learning

Become an expert in neural networks, and learn to implement them using the deep learning 
framework PyTorch. Build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks 
for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, 
and learn how to deploy models accessible from a website.



### -1-PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE
This program has been created specifically for students who are interested in machine learning, AI, 
and/or deep learning, and who have a working knowledge of Python programming, including NumPy and pandas. Outside of that Python expectation and some familiarity with calculus and linear algebra, it's a beginner-friendly program. 

### Introduction
Get your first taste of deep learning by applying style transfer to your own images, 
and gain experience using development tools such as Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks.

### Neural Networks
Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. U
se the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, 
and analyze real data.

### Convolutional Neural Networks
Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) 
based on patterns and objects that appear in them. 
Use these networks to learn data compression and image denoising.

### Recurrent Neural Networks
Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; 
perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.

### Generative Adversarial Networks
Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) 
to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, 
the creator of CycleGANs.

### Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. 
Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. 
Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
