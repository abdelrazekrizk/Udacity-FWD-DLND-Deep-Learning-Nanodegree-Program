## Course 1: Neural Networks

Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with
Python and NumPy. Youâ€™ll define and train a multi-layer neural
network, and use it to analyze real data. In this project, you
will build and train neural networks Use  the modern deep
learning framework PyTorch from scratch to predict the
number of bike-share users on a given day.
